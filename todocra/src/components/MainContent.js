      <p>It was a bright and calm morning... and the Zerg race roamed the crustaceous planet called Earth freely.</p>
      <p>Time stood still as a wild zergling went and frolicked in the bushes.
        They all knew the time was going to come, when an alien race would land on their soil.
        A distant voice with an echo was heard, and the frequency was unrecognized.
        It was time for the extermination.</p>
      <p>"Goliath online" was echoed across the still waters as spawning zerglings grew in peace.
        This was the beginning of the end.
        A warrior race called 'Humanity' was soon to take what originally belonged to the Zerg.
        It was a perilous journey into the bright and uncomfortable future for our Zerg.
